# Surfs Up
Analysis on weather data utilizing SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Jupyter Notebook, and Pandas

## Overview of Surf's Up Analysis
The purpose of this project is to utilize SQLAlchemy to query a SQLite database containing weather data from weather stations across Oahu, HI.  The two key elements to be analyzed are precipitation amounts and temperatures to determine if it's viable to open up a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, HI.

4) PH should look at expanding eligibility for the mentorship program as there are only 2% (1,549 eligible compared to 72,458 retirees) of retiring employees which meet the current criteria.


## Summary
PH is facing a significant volume of 72,458 retirees in the coming years as illustrated above.  The company needs to assess workload and other factors before determining if all retirees should be replaced.  The table below shows non-retirees outnumber retirees 2.3 : 1 per title.  It's possible the remaining workforce can keep up with the current workload, but deeper analysis is necessary.

PH should think about expanding its criteria for qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees.  There are only 1,549 eligible using their current criteria.  Expanding the birthdate range by one year to include 1964 increases the eligibility pool from 1,549 to 19,905.  SQL code is provided to show the impact of adding one year to the mentorship criteria.
